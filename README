Welcome to Sharpenguin, the C# Club Penguin client.

       written permission is received from the founder, or lead developer of this library.
    * "Version" is the current version of this library.

                                           == Usage ==
When using this library and it's files, please take into consideration that you are bound by the 
license specified above. (Copy of the license can be found in the "LICENSE" file.)

Requirements:
    * .NET 4.5+ compiler and run time.
    * An internet connection which allows access to the game's servers.

You can look at the "Example.cs" file to see an example of a project (follow bot) using this library.

                                         == Change Log ==
1.0.0:
    * Library released to the public.
    * Documentation created.

1.0.1:
    * Added IsAuthenticated property.
    * Added server name property.
    * Changed Convert.ToInt32 to int.Parse (less verbose and less namespaces used).
    * Stopped triggering the onDisconnect event when the Disconnect() method is called
      (stops onDisconnect being called twice).

1.0.2:
    * Fixed the recursive read function (I broke it at some point...?)
    * Changed a bit of documentation, since it was not up to date with the functions.
    * Added uppercase to the first words of each method in Tasks.cs, since it looks nice in C#. 
      (I hope this doesn't cause people too many brickings)

1.0.3:
    * Removed Room IDs (internal and external) from the PenguinBase class as they are stored in the
      Room object, so they can be retrieved from there.
    * Changed from synchronous to asynchronous connecting.
    * Added onConnectionSuccess event.

2.0.0:
    * Complete reform of the library. A nicer implementation.
    * Supports compilation for AS2 and AS3 using preprocessor directives.

                                       == A Brief Description ==
Features:
    * Uses asynchronous sockets.
    * Event-based system.
    * Allows, and eases, the ability to connect to Disney's Club Penguin with C#.
    * Easy to use, and implement, framework.
    * Fast as poop sliding of a shiny shovel.

                                           == Contact ==
