                                         == Change Log ==
1.0.0:
    * Library released to the public.
    * Documentation created.
    
1.0.1:
    * Added IsAuthenticated property.
    * Added server name property.
    * Changed Convert.ToInt32 to int.Parse (less verbose and less namespaces used).
    * Stopped triggering the onDisconnect event when the Disconnect() method is called
      (stops onDisconnect being called twice).
1.0.2:
    * Fixed the recursive read function (I broke it at some point...?)
    * Changed a bit of documentation, since it was not up to date with the functions.
    * Added uppercase to the first words of each method in Tasks.cs, since it looks nice in C#. 
      (I hope this doesn't cause people too many brickings)
      
                                       == A Brief Markdown ==
Fetures:
    * Uses asynchronous sockets.
    * Event-based system.
    * Allows, and eases, the ability to connect to Disney's Club Penguin with C#.
    * Easy to use, and implement, framework.
    * Fast as poop sliding of a shiny shovel.
